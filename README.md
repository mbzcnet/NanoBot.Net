# NanoBot.Net
NanoBot.Net is a .NET port of the excellent nanobot project — an ultra-lightweight personal AI assistant. Core design faithfully follows nanobot (~4,000 lines philosophy), re-implemented in C# with necessary .NET optimizations and extensions. Ideal as the core Agent component for .NET-based AIAgent products.
